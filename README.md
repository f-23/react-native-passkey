## Configuration

### iOS

There are iOS specific steps you need to go through in order to configure Passkey support. If you have already set up an associated domain for your application you can skip this step.

#### Set up an associated domain for your application ([More info](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains))

- You need to associate a domain with your application. On your webserver set up this route:

  ```
  GET https://<yourdomain>/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
  ```

- This route should serve a static JSON object containing your team id and bundle identifier.
  Example (replace XXXXXXXXXX with your team identifier and the rest with your bundle id, e.g. "H123456789.com.mtrx0.passkeyExample"):

  ```json
  {
    "applinks": {},
    "webcredentials": {
      "apps": ["XXXXXXXXXX.YYY.YYYYY.YYYYYYYYYYYYYY"]
    },
    "appclips": {}
  }
  ```

- In XCode under `Signing & Capabilities` add a new Capability of type `Associated Domains`.
  Now add this and replace XXXXXX with your domain (e.g. `apple.com`)
  ```
  webcredentials:XXXXXX
  ```
### Android

The Android specific configuration is similar to iOS. If you have already set up Digital Asset Links for your application you can skip this step.

#### Associate your app with a domain ([More info](https://developer.android.com/training/sign-in/passkeys#add-support-dal))
- You need to associate a domain with your application. On your webserver set up this route:

  ```
  GET https://<yourdomain>/.well-known/assetlinks.json
  ```

- This route should serve a static JSON object containing the following information.
  Example (replace with your data, replace SHA_HEX_VALUE with the SHA256 fingerprints of your Android signing certificate)

  ```json
  [{
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.get_login_creds"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.example",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        SHA_HEX_VALUE
      ]
    }
  }]
  ```

## Usage

#### Check if Passkeys are supported

```ts
import { Passkey } from 'react-native-passkey';

// Use this method to check if passkeys are supported on the device

const isSupported: boolean = Passkey.isSupported();
```

#### Creating a new Passkey

```ts
import { Passkey, PasskeyRegistrationResult } from 'react-native-passkey';

// Retrieve a valid FIDO2 attestation request from your server
// The challenge inside the request needs to be a base64URL encoded string
// There are plenty of libraries which can be used for this (e.g. fido2-lib)

try {
  // Call the `create` method with the retrieved request in JSON format
  // A native overlay will be displayed
  const result: PasskeyRegistrationResult = await Passkey.create(requestJson);

  // The `create` method returns a FIDO2 attestation result
  // Pass it to your server for verification
} catch (error) {
  // Handle Error...
}
```

#### Authenticating with existing Passkey

```ts
import { Passkey, PasskeyAuthenticationResult } from 'react-native-passkey';

// Retrieve a valid FIDO2 assertion request from your server 
// The challenge inside the request needs to be a base64URL encoded string
// There are plenty of libraries which can be used for this (e.g. fido2-lib)

try {
  // Call the `get` method with the retrieved request in JSON format 
  // A native overlay will be displayed
  const result: PasskeyAuthResult = await Passkey.get(requestJson);

  // The `get` method returns a FIDO2 assertion result
  // Pass it to your server for verification
} catch (error) {
  // Handle Error...
}
```

### Force Platform or Security Key (iOS-specific)

You can force users to register and authenticate using either a platform key, a security key (like [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/)) or allow both using the following methods. This only works on iOS, Android will ignore these instructions.

#### Create Passkey

- `Passkey.create()` - Allow the user to choose between platform and security passkey
- `Passkey.createPlatformKey()` - Force the user to create a platform passkey
- `Passkey.createSecurityKey()` - Force the user to create a security passkey

#### Get Passkey

- `Passkey.get()` - Allow the user to choose between platform and security passkey
- `Passkey.getPlatformKey()` - Force the user to authenticate using a platform passkey
- `Passkey.getSecurityKey()` - Force the user to authenticate using a security passkey

### Extensions

#### largeBlob

As of version 3.0 the newly added largeBlob extension should work out of the box for iOS only.

#### PRF

As of version 3.0 the newly added PRF extension should work out of the box for Android only.
